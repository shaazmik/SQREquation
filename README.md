Program for solving quadratic equations

An equation of the form ax^2+bx+c=0. 3 coefficients a, b, and c are entered. 

The output is the answer to the equation: the number of roots and the roots themselves. 

If you want, you can turn on the debag. In the header, you need to delete the "/ / " near #define DEBUG_MOD.

The file for debag must be entered with the name Tests.txt. Format:

First line is the number of tests, next:

'coefficient a' 'coefficient b' 'coefficient c' 'number of answer' 'answer №1' 'answer №2 ' (if roots are exist )
